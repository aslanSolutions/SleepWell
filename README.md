## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Our project aims to leverage the Wio Terminal, an Arduino-based device, to monitor sleep environments and provide users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. By collecting data on temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, our project enables users to gain a comprehensive understanding of their sleep patterns. The collected data is analyzed and presented to users through a simple score, indicating the quality of their sleep. By providing easy access to this information via a mobile application, our project empowers users to make informed decisions about their sleep habits and improve their overall sleep quality.




## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Here are steps to getting started

1. You should setup both of Arduino and Flutter framework. (Page is coming)
2. To upload code to the Wio Seeed Terminal using Arduino IDE, it is necessary to have the terminal device. Additionally, there will be several sensors connected to the terminal that can be used.(Page is coming)
3. Git must be installed on the device before using GitLab.(Page is coming)
4. It is required to clone the repository to work on it. (Page is coming)
5. The project requires the use of MQTT protocol, and the developers have used mosquitto for this purpose.(Page is coming)
