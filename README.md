<p align="center"> Sleep Well project utilizes the Wio Terminal as a powerful tool for monitoring the sleep environment and providing users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. Through continuous data collection of temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, the system generates a comprehensive sleep quality score. This score serves as a reliable metric for users to evaluate the effectiveness of their sleep and make informed decisions to enhance their overall sleep experience.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Our project aims to leverage the Wio Terminal, an Arduino-based device, to monitor sleep environments and provide users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. By collecting data on temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, our project enables users to gain a comprehensive understanding of their sleep patterns. The collected data is analyzed and presented to users through a simple score, indicating the quality of their sleep. By providing easy access to this information via a mobile application, our project empowers users to make informed decisions about their sleep habits and improve their overall sleep quality.


## ‚å®Ô∏è Features <a name = "Features"></a>
* Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels during sleep.
* Data collection and storage for analysis.
* Calculation of sleep quality score based on collected data.
* Visualization of sleep patterns and trends.
* Notifications and alerts for abnormal sleep conditions.
* User-friendly mobile application interface.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
[]()

To get started with your GitLab project for Arduino and Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Set up [Arduino](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE) and [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) frameworks: Before proceeding, make sure you have both Arduino and Flutter frameworks installed on your system.

2. Prepare Wio Seeed Terminal: To upload code to the Wio Seeed Terminal using Arduino IDE, ensure you have the terminal device connected to your system. Additionally, connect the necessary sensors to the terminal, as they will be used in the project.

3. Before utilizing GitLab, ensure that [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed on your device. 

4. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) the repository: To begin working on the project, clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the project that you can modify and contribute to. 

5. Utilize MQTT protocol: The project makes use of the MQTT protocol, and the developers have chosen to use mosquitto for this purpose. Familiarize yourself with MQTT and set up [mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto) to enable communication within the project.


## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
As metioned above, the project measures environmental variables during sleep to optimize sleep conditions and has potential applications in research. It provides a score indicating whether the sleeping environment was favorable or unfavorable, which can be used to adjust conditions to improve sleep quality. By analyzing the data collected, patterns and trends can be iSdentified, contributing to a better understanding of factors that influence sleep quality.


## Prerequisites <a name = "Prerequisites"></a>

* Flutter SDK <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install" target="Flutter">(installation guide)</a>  
* Dart SDK <a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart" target="Dart">(installation guide)</a>  



### Installing

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1) Install Arduino IDE and the necessary libraries.
2) Install the Flutter SDK and an IDE of your choice.
3) Connect the Wio Seeed Terminal and sensors.
4) Clone the repository.
5) Install Mosquitto.


## Acknowledgement <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>
We want to give a shout-out to everyone who helped us out with this project! First off, a huge thank you to our amazing proffessor and his loyal TAs, Francisco Gomes, Luiz Rosane and Nicole Quinstedt, for being there every step of the way with their awesome advice and encouragement. We couldn't have done it without you! Also, big ups to all of our classmates and friends who gave us feedback and support along the way. You guys are the best! And finally, a special thanks to G√∂teborg's University for hooking us up with the cash to make this happen. We appreciate your support more than you know. Last but not least, our group members with all the hard work they did during the course period.
Thanks again, everyone!


## Authors and contributions <a name = "authors"></a>
Here is a short list of all the members and their contribution to this project:
1. @josefab: I did thourough research in flutter (udemy course) before starting with the implementation process. After coming up with ideas i started with the layout build. We then started working on the gui. I manily participated in creating the homescreen (and the widgets around it) and a big part of the sleep log screen. I also worked on the logic side of the app with the score alogithm. 
2. @muhmmad: implementing the sound sensor for the Wio device. Additionally, I added download and installation instructions to the wiki page, created the score screen and loading screen, and refactored the code to adhere to SOLID principles. These enhancements significantly improve the code's functionality, readability, and usability.
3. @yousefab: 
I was in charge of creating the sleep screen functionality, ensuring that our users have¬†a seamless and user-friendly experience.
I created the initial sleep well design¬†, as I focused on creating an¬†appealing interface.
Furthermore, I was in charge of developing the logo for our sleep well application.
In addition, I prepared our marketing video which successfully demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of our project to stakeholders and potential consumers.
4. @qutaiba: I worked on several tasks for the Wio project. I implemented the light sensor code for the GUI, worked on the sleep log screen, redesigned some parts of the app, fixed bugs and wrapped up some end losses. Additionally, I worked on documentation for the GitLab.
5. @elhasan: 
6. @nawrask: For the WIO, I worked on the screen so it displays 5 different screens and implementing the temperature sensor. For the app i worked on the log screen and the log screen controller. Polished and cleaned up some classes. Finally, i reviewd the code implementation for some of the issues we had during this project.
