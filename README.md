# Sleep Well

## Description
This project is about using Wio Terminal (arduino-based device) to moniter the environment during our sleep. The sensors will gather temprature, humidity, light and noise level data throughout the entire night to give a score at the end. This score determense how good of a sleep quality you had when you wake up. The log data will be saved either on the web or on a mobile application. The code for that program will be included here as well. 

## Visuals
screenshots and giffs will be implemented here

## Installation
To run the exact same system you will need a Wio Terminal and an Andriod phone or a computer (haven't decided yet on what platform the program will be made for). 

1. Then you need the following sensors: 
  -  x1
  -  x2 
  -  x3
2. Now that all the hardware is here, you will need to install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and implement the Wio Terminal Library inside the Arduino IDE. This can be done by going File > Preferences, then paste this [URL](https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json) to Additional Boards Manager. 
3. Now you need to select and install the Wio Terminal board by Tools > Board > Board Manager and Search Wio Terminal. 
4. Once that is done, you can now select the board from the board list and cope/paste the arduino code in this project. 
5. All that is left now is to verify and upload the code to your Wio Terminal. 
6. When it comes to the Andriod App or computer web-based program, we have no idea yet.....

 
## Usage


## Support
Support for this project will remain untill 25-5-2023. During this period you can contact any of the member creators (not the Teacher nor the TAs) and we will gladly help. 
When the above date is passed, the work on this project will stop, ending the support for it as well. 

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are more than welcome, the project is and will remain open source with the aim for future improvements for the enthusiast. We (the creators) will not push any further versions. Thus, we are leaving the project in your creativity playground for development. 
Steps on how to install and run the project are descriped with steps in the [Installation](#I)
