# Sleep Well

## Introducation
Welcome to our project, which is focused on using the Wio Terminal, an Arduino-based device, to monitor the environment during sleep. Our aim is to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of their sleep quality by gathering data on temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night. At the end of each night, the collected data is analyzed and assigned a score, indicating the quality of the user's sleep. We plan to save this data on a mobile application for easy access and further analysis. Here, you will find the code for the program, as well as any additional information related to the project.

## Instruction

### Installation

Here are steps to install the project: 
1. You should setup both of Arduino and Flutter framework. (Page is coming)
2. To upload code to the Wio Seeed Terminal using Arduino IDE, it is necessary to have the terminal device. Additionally, there will be several sensors connected to the terminal that can be used.(Page is coming)
3. Git must be installed on the device before using GitLab.(Page is coming)
4. It is required to clone the repository to work on it. (Page is coming)
5. The project requires the use of MQTT protocol, and the developers have used mosquitto for this purpose.(Page is coming)

### Configuration
1. To run Wio terminal on Arduino IDE, certain libraries are necessary.
2. To run the project, it is necessary to download and set up the Flutter SDK. There are different IDE choices available for running Dart code.
 
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
