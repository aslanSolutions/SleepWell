<p align="center"> Sleep Well project utilizes the Wio Terminal as a powerful tool for monitoring the sleep environment and providing users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. Through continuous data collection of temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, the system generates a comprehensive sleep quality score. This score serves as a reliable metric for users to evaluate the effectiveness of their sleep and make informed decisions to enhance their overall sleep experience.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Our project aims to leverage the Wio Terminal, an Arduino-based device, to monitor sleep environments and provide users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. By collecting data on temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, our project enables users to gain a comprehensive understanding of their sleep patterns. The collected data is analyzed and presented to users through a simple score, indicating the quality of their sleep. By providing easy access to this information via a mobile application, our project empowers users to make informed decisions about their sleep habits and improve their overall sleep quality.


## ‚å®Ô∏è Features <a name = "Features"></a>
* Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels during sleep.
* Data collection and storage for analysis.
* Calculation of sleep quality score based on collected data.
* Visualization of sleep patterns and trends.
* Notifications and alerts for abnormal sleep conditions.
* User-friendly mobile application interface.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
[]()

To get started with your GitLab project for Arduino and Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Set up [Arduino](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE) and [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) frameworks: Before proceeding, make sure you have both Arduino and Flutter frameworks installed on your system.

2. Prepare Wio Seeed Terminal: To upload code to the Wio Seeed Terminal using Arduino IDE, ensure you have the terminal device connected to your system. Additionally, connect the necessary sensors to the terminal, as they will be used in the project.

3. Before utilizing GitLab, ensure that [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed on your device. 

4. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) the repository: To begin working on the project, clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the project that you can modify and contribute to. 

5. Utilize MQTT protocol: The project makes use of the MQTT protocol, and the developers have chosen to use mosquitto for this purpose. Familiarize yourself with MQTT and set up [mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto) to enable communication within the project.






Here are steps to getting started

1. You should setup both of Arduino and Flutter framework. (Page is coming)
2. To upload code to the Wio Seeed Terminal using Arduino IDE, it is necessary to have the terminal device. Additionally, there will be several sensors connected to the terminal that can be used.(Page is coming)
3. Git must be installed on the device before using GitLab.(Page is coming)
4. It is required to clone the repository to work on it. (Page is coming)
5. The project requires the use of MQTT protocol, and the developers have used mosquitto for this purpose.(Page is coming)

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
As metioned above, the project measures environmental variables during sleep to optimize sleep conditions and has potential applications in research. It provides a score indicating whether the sleeping environment was favorable or unfavorable, which can be used to adjust conditions to improve sleep quality. By analyzing the data collected, patterns and trends can be iSdentified, contributing to a better understanding of factors that influence sleep quality.


## Prerequisites <a name = "Prerequisites"></a>

* Flutter SDK <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install" target="Flutter">(installation guide)</a>  
* Dart SDK <a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart" target="Dart">(installation guide)</a>  



### Installing

## Acknowledgement <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>
We want to give a shout-out to everyone who helped us out with this project! First off, a huge thank you to our amazing proffessor and his loyal TAs, Francisco Gomes, Luiz Rosane and Nicole Quinstedt, for being there every step of the way with their awesome advice and encouragement. We couldn't have done it without you! Also, big ups to all of our classmates and friends who gave us feedback and support along the way. You guys are the best! And finally, a special thanks to G√∂teborg's univercity for hooking us up with the cash to make this happen. We appreciate your support more than you know. Last but not least, our group members with all the hard work they did during the course period.
Thanks again, everyone!
