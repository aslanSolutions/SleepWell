# Sleep Well

## Description
This project is about using Wio Terminal (arduino-based device) to moniter the environment during our sleep. The sensors will gather temprature, humidity, light and noise level data throughout the entire night to give a score at the end. This score determense how good of a sleep quality you had when you wake up. The log data will be saved either on the web or on a mobile application. The code for that program will be included here as well. 

## Visuals
screenshots and giffs will be implemented here

## Installation
To run the exact same system you will need a Wio Terminal and an Andriod phone or a computer (haven't decided yet on what platform the program will be made for). 
- [ ] 
Then you need the following sensors: 
 - - [ ] x1
 - - [ ] x2 
 - - [ ] x3

- [ ] 
Now that all the hardware is here, you will need to install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and implement the Wio Terminal Library inside the Arduino IDE. This can be done by going File > Preferences, then paste this [URL](https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json) to Additional Boards Manager. 
- [ ] 
Now you need to select and install the Wio Terminal board by Tools > Board > Board Manager and Search Wio Terminal. 
- [ ] 
Once that is done, you can now select the board from the board list and cope/paste the arduino code in this project. 
- [ ] 
All that is left now is to verify and upload the code to your Wio Terminal. 

- [ ] 
When it comes to the Andriod App or computer web-based program, we have no idea yet.....

 
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
